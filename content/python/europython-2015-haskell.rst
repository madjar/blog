 Through the lens of Haskell: exploring new ideas for library design

At EuroPython 2014, there was a talk about `"What Python can learn
from Haskell"`_, which was very interesting, and seems to have
sparkled the `PEP 484`_ (type annotations in python 3.5). This shows
once more that sharing between languages can result in improvements
for everybody involved.

.. _`PEP 484`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/

In this talk, we take another look at Haskell. However, rather than
looking at the language itself, we'll look at how the community finds
ideas for tools and libraries by exploring the "design space"

I gave this talk at EuroPython 2015. The quality of the video is not
very good (my blue-coloring vga output doesn't help), so here is a
link to `the slides`__.
