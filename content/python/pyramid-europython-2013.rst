Pyramid is a great framework, and one of the things that makes it
great is its configuration system, which provide both a great way to
organize an application, and an elegant system to write
extensions.

This talk explain how the configuration system works and how
to use it, then uses example from recognized projects to show how to
make the most out of it, both for structuring applications and writing extensions.

This is a talk I gave last summer at the Europython, and I just
realized it might be a good idea to post it here. The slides are
available here__.
