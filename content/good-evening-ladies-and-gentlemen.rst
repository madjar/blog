Hi, I'm Georges Dubus, I'm a french PhD student doing some hacking on
his free time, and here is my tentative of a blog.

I have wanted to start a blog for a long time, but never really did it
by lack of content idea, motivation, and platform. I have finally
gathered enough time and courage to do it. For the first post, here is
a little technical review of the tools I used to create this, and a
few words about what to expect here in the future.

Creating the blog
-----------------

The blog generation engine I use is pelican_, which is written in
python by Alexis Metaireau. It's a nice, simple blog engine with posts
in rst_ and page templates in jinja2_. That way, I could
create the layout with my usual IDE, PyCharm_, and I can edit posts
with emacs_. The whole thing is hosted as static github pages.

.. _rst : http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _jinja2 : http://jinja.pocoo.org/
.. _PyCharm : http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
.. _emacs : http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

The theme is based on the default pelican theme, with some
modifications. The main modification is the color theme, which is
based on a palette_ I found on the internet and I liked.

Future content
--------------

As for the content of this blog, it should mostly be technical
articles about python stuff and the code I write, but maybe more
eclectic content about other things, like my thesis if I find
something blog-suitable to say, or some interesting thoughts I may
have.

By the way, the name of the blog means "Compile thyself" in french,
and the title of this post is what the french scientist starts his
speach with in "Close encounter of the third kind".
